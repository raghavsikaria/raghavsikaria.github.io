*Hello, this is me!*

I am Raghav Sikaria, currently pursuing MS in Computer Science at New York University here in New York in United States. Previously, I was working as an Associate at Goldman Sachs in Bengaluru. I've also worked as a Data Scientist and Specialist Software Engineer at Societe Generale prior to Goldman. You can find me doing some Hindi Poetry in open-mic spots in the city. I used to be a professional theatre artist - did a few gigs with TVF Timeliners, NSD(National School of Drama), Crea-Shakthi Theatre group and VIT(my alma mater) Dramatics Club. Owing to my interest in finance I also cleared CFA Level 1 examination back in 2020 and then covid happened :) \[Though I am open to working for all domains]

I made this site because I have wanted to blog since forever, share my thoughts & poems, my projects for being presentable in the industry and above all - because I wanted one!

These past 2 years I've had life changing experience, and it amazes me how times passes. I always like to remind myself the time I've come from. So here's a snapshot from my board + life back from Jan 2020:

*My state + motto + mantra + ambitions back in Jan 2020*

And this was my timeline graph back then - which contributed in shaping my philosophy on life and professional career:
