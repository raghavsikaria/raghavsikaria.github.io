*Hello, this is me!*

I am an engineer by profession, who wants to venture out into the domain of FinTech. Currently I am looking for roles in Data Science, Quantitative Research/Analyst/Developer or Software Engineering for Fintech domains. Also, I used to be a professional theatre artist - did a few gigs with TVF Timeliners, NSD(National School of Drama), Crea-Shakthi Theatre group and VIT(my alma mater) Dramatics Club.

Have drained myself completely during the COVID Lockdown here in India. Building a personal website had long been my dream, and after all these years of excuses; the lockdown had given me just the time for it! So I made this site because I have wanted to blog since forever, share my thoughts & poems, share my projects for being presentable in the FinTech domain for which I am crushing hard to penetrate and above all - because I wanted one!

Here is what has been happening on my board + life for past few months:

And this is my timeline - some of the most important milestones in recent years which have contributed in shaping my philosophy on life and professional career:
