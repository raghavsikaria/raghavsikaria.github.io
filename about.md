*Hello, this is me!*

I currently am a Specialist Software Engineer at Societe Generale here in Bengaluru and have cleared the CFA Level 1 examination. I aspire to work in the domain of Data Science. I also am exploring Quantitative Finance as a hobby. Also, I used to be a professional theatre artist - did a few gigs with TVF Timeliners, NSD(National School of Drama), Crea-Shakthi Theatre group and VIT(my alma mater) Dramatics Club.

Have drained myself completely during the COVID Lockdown here in India. Building a personal website had long been my dream, and after all these years of excuses; the lockdown had given me just the time for it! So I made this site because I have wanted to blog since forever, share my thoughts & poems, share my projects for being presentable in the Data Science domain for which I am crushing hard to penetrate and above all - because I wanted one!

Here is what has been happening on my board + life for past few months:

*My current state + motto + mantra + ambitions*

And this is my timeline - some of the most important milestones in recent years which have contributed in shaping my philosophy on life and professional career:
