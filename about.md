![About me image](assets/about_me.jpg)

Have drained myself completely during the COVID Lockdown here in India, and just built this entire site in a day essentially leaving me at a loss of words.
Nevertheless, I am your not so extra-ordinary sapien, who wants to venture out into the domain of FinTech. Like half of the country, I too did engineering (from VIT, Vellore) and my passion for coding and finance led me to clear CFA L1 - December'19. Oh, and I also used to be somewhat a professional theatre artist in another life.
On this site, you'll find my most interesting projects all pertaining to FinTech.
